[Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) is one of the best frameworks that we have ever saw in terms of software design, hence, we decided to write a bunch of tools for its developers to pave the way for further usage.

[aurelia-toolbelt](https://github.com/shahabganji/aurelia-toolbelt) is that, in which we tried to gather the best libraries in Javascript world together in aurelia fashion. Writing custom-elements, value-converters, and so on. We tried not to invent the wheel, so most of the work is a wrapper, or bridge( am not sure whether the way that we coded can be called bridge or not), around other libraries. 


* Its is utterly important for us to provide a link as a reference to the libraries used, or inspired from, so that other developers can visit their product and decide on their own to use which, besides it's one way that we can respect the time and effort of those programmers.

* All libraries used in aurelia-toolbelt are open-source and free of charge; most of which are **_[MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)_**, however we will provide  definition whenever it differs.

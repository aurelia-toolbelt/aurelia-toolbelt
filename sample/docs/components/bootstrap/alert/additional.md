You can either go [bootstrap way](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/#additional-content), or aurelia way


```html
<abt-alert type="success">
  <abt-alert-heading>
    <h4>Well done!</h4>
  </abt-alert-heading>
  <p>Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so
    that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="mb-0">Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.</p>
</abt-alert>
```

            Verne was born in the seaport of Nantes, where he was trained to follow in his father's footsteps as a lawyer, but quit the
            profession early in life to write for magazines and the stage. His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules
            Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched
            adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea
            (1870), and Around the World in Eighty Days (1873).
